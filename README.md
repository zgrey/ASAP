# ASAP
Data supporting paper submission titled Active Subspaces of Airfoil shape Parameterizations (ASAP). Note, the contained code was run and designed in a manner to be executed in a "block format" (i.e., one block at a time). Meaning, the master script "mixsamples.m" is not intended to act as a stand-alone script to be executed blindly (although it may likely run succesfully if executed blindly). Rather, it is suggested that any end user open and interpret the contents of mixsamples.m to adapt functionality as necessary and run blocks as necessary. There are dependencies that are not included in this repository and will require a fork of the developmental branch from (in particular the matlab routines):
